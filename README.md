# 🎮 Simon Says Game

A fun and interactive **Simon Says** memory game built using **HTML, CSS, and jQuery**. This project was created as part of my learning journey through **The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp by App Brewery on Udemy**.

## 📚 About the Project

This project replicates the classic Simon Says game:
- The game shows a sequence of colors.
- The user must repeat the sequence by clicking colored buttons.
- If the sequence is correct, the level increases.
- If the user makes a mistake, the game resets with a "Game Over" message.

This was one of my first JavaScript projects where I implemented real user interactions and DOM manipulation using **jQuery**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- jQuery
- JavaScript

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. A color will flash—click the button of the same color.
3. Repeat the sequence as it grows each level.
4. Make a mistake? The game will let you know and restart.
